    sub1: "The Islamic Perspective on Early Marriage",
    paragraph1: `Marriage in Islam is more than a social contract—it is a sacred bond that protects faith, nurtures character, and brings peace of mind. In today's world, many young Muslims delay marriage due to career goals, financial concerns, or social pressure. However, Islamic teachings and modern studies show that early marriage provides barakah, stability, and long-term happiness.\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم encouraged early marriage for youth. He said: "O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty." (Bukhari & Muslim) This hadith emphasizes that marriage is a shield against temptation. Islam recognizes natural human desires and provides a halal way to fulfill them. Delaying marriage without a valid reason may lead to fitnah (trials), especially in today's world where indecency is widespread.\n\nAllah also reassures believers in the Qur'an: "And marry those among you who are single… If they are poor, Allah will enrich them from His bounty." (Qur'an 24:32) This verse teaches that financial worry should not prevent early marriage. Trust in Allah's provision (rizq) is part of faith.\n\nAnother hadith highlights the virtue of marriage: "Marriage is part of my sunnah, and whoever does not follow my sunnah has nothing to do with me." (Ibn Majah) Marriage is a way to follow the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, earn Allah's pleasure, and enjoy the blessings of a halal marital relationship.`,
    sub2: "Worldly Benefits of Early Marriage",
    paragraph2: `Modern psychology and sociology confirm the wisdom of early marriage for young Muslims:\n• Emotional Growth Together: Couples who marry young learn to compromise, grow, and adapt as a team.\n• Better Mental Health: Married individuals experience stability, less loneliness, and higher satisfaction.\n• Energetic Parenting: Young parents can raise children with more energy and active involvement.\n• Deeper Bonds: Facing life challenges together strengthens love and partnership.\nDelaying marriage may increase stress, temptation, and the risk of unhealthy attachments. Muslim marriage advice emphasizes starting life together on a halal and blessed foundation.`,

    description: "Many young Muslims today delay marriage for financial reasons, but Islam teaches that rizq comes from Allah. Early, responsible marriage brings blessings, love and companionship.",
    sub1: "The Islamic Perspective on Marriage and Rizq",
    paragraph1: `Many young Muslims today delay marriage believing they must first achieve financial stability. While being responsible with money is important, Islam teaches that rizq (sustenance) comes from Allah. Delaying marriage solely for wealth can prevent couples from experiencing blessings, love, and companionship early in life.\n\nAllah reassures believers in the Qur'an: "And marry those among you who are single… If they are poor, Allah will enrich them from His bounty." (Qur'an 24:32)\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم also advised: "O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, for it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty." (Bukhari & Muslim)\n\nEven Ali (RA) married Fatima (RA) with very little wealth, yet Allah blessed their marriage abundantly. This teaches that marriage is not delayed by financial fear but built on faith, character, and trust in Allah's provision.`,
    sub2: "The Worldly Perspective",

      "Choose a partner based on deen and character, not wealth.",
      "Parents should avoid delaying their children's nikah due to financial concerns."

    conclusion: "Financial stability is valuable, but it should never be the sole reason to delay marriage. Islamic teachings and worldly research agree: strong marriages are built on faith, character, teamwork, and trust in Allah. Early marriage, approached responsibly, brings blessings, happiness, and lifelong companionship.",

    sub1: "Understanding Halal Courtship vs. Dating",
    paragraph1: `Halal courtship is a guided process where two individuals explore compatibility for marriage while adhering to Islamic principles. Unlike modern dating, it avoids physical intimacy and private interactions that could lead to temptation. Prophetic Guidance: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم emphasized marriage as a shield against immorality: "O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry…" (Bukhari & Muslim) Dating without guidelines often leads to emotional attachment outside marriage, encourages secrecy and indecency, conflicts with Islamic values, and increases temptation and fitnah. Halal courtship provides a structured alternative that protects faith, fosters respect, and ensures long-term compatibility. Key Principles: Maintain Modesty and Boundaries - Communicate with intention: discussions should focus on marriage goals, values, and future plans. Avoid physical contact or private encounters. Use chaperones or family supervision when meeting in person. Clear Communication and Honesty - Be open about intentions, priorities, and expectations. Discuss religious practices, lifestyle, and family values early. Avoid misleading or dishonest behavior. Family Involvement - Families play a critical role in halal courtship: Provide guidance and supervision, Facilitate introductions and meetings, Offer insight into compatibility, Prevent misunderstandings or impulsive decisions.`,
